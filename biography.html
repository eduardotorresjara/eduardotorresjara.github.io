    <h2>Biography</h2>
	<p>
    
	I was born in Cuenca, Ecuador . Cuenca is known as the "Athens" of Ecuador because of its cultural activity. While I was there, I attended to Colegio Tecnico Salesiano High School. This high school was one of the best experiences. Then I moved to Quito, the capital of Ecuador, to study Electronic Engineering. After graduation, I worked for a short period in AT &amp T Paradyne and then I decided to start my own thing. I designed and together with a friend I developed a general purpose controller (uMatic). After this first experience, I got involved in starting a software and communications company. I was the CTO of this company for a few years. Then I started the telecommuncations division in a different company. At that point I decided that a change of enviroment would be interesting and I came to MIT where I got my master's and my PhD. Currently, I am a postdoctoral associate at the CSAIL lab.
